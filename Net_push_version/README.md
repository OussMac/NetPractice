# NetPractice

## Description
NetPractice is a practical networking project designed to introduce the fundamentals of computer networks.  
The goal of this project is to understand and correctly configure IPv4 addressing, subnet masks, gateways, and routers in order to make small network topologies function properly.

The project consists of solving 10 networking exercises using a web-based training interface, where each level presents a non-functional network diagram that must be fixed through correct configuration.

## Instructions

### Running the training interface
1. Download the NetPractice files from the 42 project page.
2. Extract the files into any directory.
3. Open the `index.html` file using **Google Chrome or a Chromium-based browser**.
   (Firefox may not work due to security restrictions.)
4. Enter your 42 login in the interface.
5. Solve each level by modifying the unshaded fields.
6. After completing a level, click **Get my config** to export the configuration file.

### Submission requirements
- You must complete **10 levels**.
- You must export **one configuration file per level**.
- All 10 exported files must be placed at the **root of this repository**.
- Only the files in this repository will be evaluated.

## Resources

### Networking concepts studied
- TCP/IP addressing (IPv4)
- Subnet masks and CIDR notation
- Network and broadcast addresses
- Default gateways
- Routers and switches
- Communication between networks
- OSI model (Layer 2 vs Layer 3)

### References
- [RFC 791 – Internet Protocol](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc791.html)
- [TCP/IP and Subnetting documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/networking/tcpip-addressing-and-subnetting)
- [OSI Model](https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/osi-model/)

### Use of AI
AI tools were used to:
- Help summarize networking concepts.
- Clarify subnetting logic and gateway behavior.
- Help with research and information gathering.

All configurations and final decisions were made with full understanding and verified manually.
