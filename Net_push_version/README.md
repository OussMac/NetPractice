# NetPractice

## Description
NetPractice is a practical networking project designed to introduce the fundamentals of computer networks.

The goal of this project is to understand and correctly configure IPv4 addressing, subnet masks, default gateways, routers, and basic network communication so that small network topologies function correctly.

The project consists of solving 10 networking exercises using a web-based training interface.  
Each level presents a non-functional network diagram that must be fixed by configuring the correct network parameters in the unshaded fields.

## Instructions

### Running the training interface
1. Download the NetPractice project files from the official 42 subject page.
2. Extract the files into any directory on your computer.
3. Open the `index.html` file using **Google Chrome or a Chromium-based browser**.  
   (Firefox may not work correctly due to security restrictions.)
4. Enter your 42 login when prompted.
5. Solve each level by modifying only the unshaded configuration fields.
6. Once a level is solved, click **“Get my config”**.
7. Save the downloaded configuration file when prompted by your browser.

### Submission requirements
- You must complete **10 levels**.
- You must export **one configuration file per level**.
- The exported files correspond to **levels 1 through 10**.
- All **10 exported configuration files** must be placed at the **root of this Git repository**.
- Only the files present in the repository root will be evaluated.

## Resources

### Networking concepts studied
This project covers the following networking concepts:
- TCP/IP addressing (IPv4)
- Subnet masks and CIDR notation
- Network and broadcast addresses
- Default gateways
- Routers and switches
- Communication between different networks
- OSI model (Layer 2 vs Layer 3 concepts)

### References
- [RFC 791 – Internet Protocol](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc791.html)
- [TCP/IP and Subnetting documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/networking/tcpip-addressing-and-subnetting)

### Use of AI
AI tools were used during this project for:
- Summarizing networking concepts.
- Clarifying subnetting logic and default gateway behavior.
- Assisting with research and understanding theoretical concepts.

All network configurations and final answers were produced manually, fully understood, and verified by the author.
